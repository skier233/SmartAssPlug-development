# Safe Use

!!! danger "Always use the plug with a condom!"

    The plug was designed to be always used covered with a condom. Although the acetone vapour smoothing makes the plug water tight and seals teh surface pretty well, the silicone coil is still hard to clean. And disassembling the coil after each use for cleaning is very laborious. So please do yourself a favor by always using a condom.

!!! warning "SmartAss Plug is not water tight"

    The plug is not water tight. Especially on the cap there are many openings where water could enter into the plug and damage the electronics. Do not rinse it under water and be cautious with lube. Always use a condom to protect the plug.
