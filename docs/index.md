!!! warning "This project is in a very early stage"

    This project is in its infancy. The PCB may still contain undiscovered bugs. And a firmware is not yet available. Do not attempt to recreate this unless you really know what you are doing and want to contribute to this project.

# SmartAss Plug - A Smart Butt Plug

Everything becomes "smart" these days. And there is no exception for butt plugs. While many butt plugs claim "smartness", just connecting it to the internet typically only means a remote control with more range. However **SmartAss Plug** has some more tricks up its sleeves. It's main purpose is not to vibrate a butt, but to sense and gauge sexual arousal. Having a reliable way to measure sexual arousal and orgasms opens up many possibility for the kinky minded person. Pneumatic anal probes have long time being the preferred choice in the clinical sector. However, in the kinky maker space the inflatable butt plug has gained more traction. Not least because of open source projects like the [nogasm](https://github.com/nogasm/nogasm) and the [protogasm](https://github.com/night-howler/protogasm). However, the inflatable butt plug suffers from a really bad signal to noise ratio. **SmartAss Plug** tries to build on these groundwork adding a more reliable sensor element, a more robust clench detection algorithm utilizing a kalman filter and calculus. All in a self-contained unit doing away with trip wires. In order to control a pleasure inducing device it connects to [XToys](https://xtoys.app/) or [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) / [infitface](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central).

Naturally it vibrates, too (kind of a minimum requirement, obviously) and comes with more fun like a 9-DoF IMU and RGB Leds. Because, why not?

And last but not least, you are finally able to serve a website straight from your ass. How far has humanity come?

## Features

- Measures the involuntarily clenches of the pelvic floor to derive the arousal level of the wearer.
- Arousal classifier with the states "neutral", "aroused", "edging" or "orgasm".
- Vibration motor (plug sizes S & M only) for feedback, cheating in chess or stimulation.
- 9-DoF IMU to determine the absolute position of the plug for position training. (Not implemented, yet)
- Connects to your Wi-Fi or creates its own access point.
- Internal webserver to serve you the user interface straight from your butt.
- The inevitable RGB-led to make your butt shine colorful.
- Open WebSocket based API to integrate with your projects. (XToys and Buttplug.io support are pending)

## F.A.Q.

### What is the benefit of the coiled tube over an inflatable butt plug?

Using an inflatable butt plug is the traditional approach for edging and orgasm detection as introduced by the original nogasm. However, using this comes with some notable downsides. For some the size of these plugs can be daunting. Also the inflated portion - which is the actual sensor - sits behind the anal sphincter most of the time. As the signal we are looking for is the involuntarily clenching of the pelvic floor, the signal to noise ratio of an inflatable butt plug is not that great. It does pick up a lot of noise like breathing or even the heart beat. These signals can falsely trigger the algorithm leading to unsatisfying results. The coiled silicone tube sits exactly where the clenches happen resulting in a much cleaner signal to start with.

### Where can I buy this?

So far you can't buy it. You need to build it yourself sourcing all the required materials on your own. Consult the [sourcing guide](sourcing.md) for more information.

### Does it integrate with XToys or Buttplug.io?

SmartAss Plug offers a WebSocket API which makes it easy to integrate. XToys and Buttplug.io support is planned, but not implemented, yet.

### Is it available in different sizes?

Yes, the plug is available in 3 different sizes to accommodate a wide range of tastes.

!!! Question "Can I sell this on my webshop?"

    Yes, of course! You may start producing the PCB and the plug and sell it on your shop. The license was deliberately chosen to allow a commercial use by whoever is willing to go through the woes of starting their own business. However, the tech-kinky scene is rather limited in size and thus you must give back any improvements such that the kinky maker scene can take advantages of it. Please drop me a note if you sell it, so that I can include it into the sourcing guide.
